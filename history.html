  <h1>History of Windows 10</h1>
  <p>Windows 10 is an operating system developed by Microsoft. Microsoft described Windows 10 as an "operating system as a service" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise
    environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace, or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support. Terry Myerson, executive
    vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, said that the goal of this model was to reduce fragmentation across the Windows platform.</p>
  <p>Mainstream builds of Windows 10 are labeled "YYMM", with YY representing the two-digit year and MM representing the month of planned release (for example, version 1507 refers to builds which initially released in July 2015).
    <br>
  <h2>Version 1507</h2>
  The original version of Windows 10 (codenamed "Threshold 1" and retroactively named version 1507) was released in July 2015. It carries the build number 10.0.10240; while Microsoft has stated that there was no designated release to manufacturing
  (RTM) build of Windows 10, build 10240 was described as an RTM build by various media outlets. It was retroactively named "version 1507" by Microsoft per its naming conventions for future stable releases of the operating system.
  <br>
  Notable changes in this version include:-<br>


  <ul>
    <li>An updated start menu</li>
    <li>The introduction of Cortana, a virtual assistant, to the desktop version of Windows</li>
    <li>A "Continuum" mode that allows users to switch between desktop mode and tablet mode</li>
    <li>"Action Center," which includes notifications and quick access to settings</li>
    <li>A new web browser, Microsoft Edge, that replaces Internet Explorer as the default browser in Windows</li>
    <li>Improved multitasking, including virtual desktops</li>
    <li>Many updated built-in apps</li>
  </ul>

  The final release was made available to Windows Insiders on July 15, 2015, followed by a public release on July 29, 2015. Support of version 1507 ended on May 9, 2017 for devices in the Current Branch and Current Branch for Business; however,
