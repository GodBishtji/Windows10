<h1>ACCESS CONTROL </h1>
<p><strong>Applies to</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10</li>
<li>Windows Server 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>This topic for the IT professional describes access control in Windows, which is the process of authorizing users, groups, and computers to access objects on the network or computer. Key concepts that make up access control are permissions, ownership of objects, inheritance of permissions, user rights, and object auditing.</p>
<h2 id="feature-description"><a href="" id="bkmk-over"></a>Feature description<a class="docon docon-link heading-anchor" href="#feature-description" aria-labelledby="feature-description"></a></h2>
<p>Computers that are running a supported version of Windows can control the use of system and network resources through the interrelated mechanisms of authentication and authorization. After a user is authenticated, the Windows operating system uses built-in authorization and access control technologies to implement the second phase of protecting resources: determining if an authenticated user has the correct permissions to access a resource.</p>
<p>Shared resources are available to users and groups other than the resource’s owner, and they need to be protected from unauthorized use. In the access control model, users and groups (also referred to as security principals) are represented by unique security identifiers (SIDs). They are assigned rights and permissions that inform the operating system what each user and group can do. Each resource has an owner who grants permissions to security principals. During the access control check, these permissions are examined to determine which security principals can access the resource and how they can access it.</p>
<p>Security principals perform actions (which include Read, Write, Modify, or Full control) on objects. Objects include files, folders, printers, registry keys, and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) objects. Shared resources use access control lists (ACLs) to assign permissions. This enables resource managers to enforce access control in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deny access to unauthorized users and groups</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set well-defined limits on the access that is provided to authorized users and groups</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Object owners generally grant permissions to security groups rather than to individual users. Users and computers that are added to existing groups assume the permissions of that group. If an object (such as a folder) can hold other objects (such as subfolders and files), it is called a container. In a hierarchy of objects, the relationship between a container and its content is expressed by referring to the container as the parent. An object in the container is referred to as the child, and the child inherits the access control settings of the parent. Object owners often define permissions for container objects, rather than individual child objects, to ease access control management.</p>
<h2 id="practical-applications"><a href="" id="bkmk-app"></a>Practical applications<a class="docon docon-link heading-anchor" href="#practical-applications" aria-labelledby="practical-applications"></a></h2>
<p>Administrators who use the supported version of Windows can refine the application and management of access control to objects and subjects to provide the following security:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Protect a greater number and variety of network resources from misuse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provision users to access resources in a manner that is consistent with organizational policies and the requirements of their jobs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enable users to access resources from a variety of devices in numerous locations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update users’ ability to access resources on a regular basis as an organization’s policies change or as users’ jobs change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Account for a growing number of use scenarios (such as access from remote locations or from a rapidly expanding variety of devices, such as tablet computers and mobile phones).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify and resolve access issues when legitimate users are unable to access resources that they need to perform their jobs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="permissions">Permissions<a class="docon docon-link heading-anchor" href="#permissions" aria-labelledby="permissions"></a></h2>
<p>Permissions define the type of access that is granted to a user or group for an object or object property. For example, the Finance group can be granted Read and Write permissions for a file named Payroll.dat.</p>
<p>By using the access control user interface, you can set NTFS permissions for objects such as files, Active Directory objects, registry objects, or system objects such as processes. Permissions can be granted to any user, group, or computer. It is a good practice to assign permissions to groups because it improves system performance when verifying access to an object.</p>
<p>For any object, you can grant permissions to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Groups, users, and other objects with security identifiers in the domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Groups and users in that domain and any trusted domains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Local groups and users on the computer where the object resides.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The permissions attached to an object depend on the type of object. For example, the permissions that can be attached to a file are different from those that can be attached to a registry key. Some permissions, however, are common to most types of objects. These common permissions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modify</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change owner</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you set permissions, you specify the level of access for groups and users. For example, you can let one user read the contents of a file, let another user make changes to the file, and prevent all other users from accessing the file. You can set similar permissions on printers so that certain users can configure the printer and other users can only print.</p>
<p>When you need to change the permissions on a file, you can run Windows Explorer, right-click the file name, and click <strong>Properties</strong>. On the <strong>Security</strong> tab, you can change permissions on the file. For more information, see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc770962.aspx" data-linktype="external">Managing Permissions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another kind of permissions, called share permissions, is set on the Sharing tab of a folder's <strong>Properties</strong> page or by using the Shared Folder Wizard. For more information see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc754178.aspx" data-linktype="external">Share and NTFS Permissions on a File Server</a>.</p>

<h1>Security identifiers</h1>
<p><strong>Applies to</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10</li>
<li>Windows Server 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>This topic for the IT professional describes security identifiers and how they work in regards to accounts and groups in the Windows operating system.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-security-identifiers">What are security identifiers?<a class="docon docon-link heading-anchor" href="#what-are-security-identifiers" aria-labelledby="what-are-security-identifiers"></a></h2>
<p>A security identifier (SID) is used to uniquely identify a security principal or security group. Security principals can represent any entity that can be authenticated by the operating system, such as a user account, a computer account, or a thread or process that runs in the security context of a user or computer account.</p>
<p>Each account or group, or process running in the security context of the account, has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as a Windows domain controller. It is stored in a security database. The system generates the SID that identifies a particular account or group at the time the account or group is created. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it can never be used again to identify another user or group.</p>
<p>Each time a user signs in, the system creates an access token for that user. The access token contains the user's SID, user rights, and the SIDs for any groups the user belongs to. This token provides the security context for whatever actions the user performs on that computer.</p>
<p>In addition to the uniquely created, domain-specific SIDs that are assigned to specific users and groups, there are well-known SIDs that identify generic groups and generic users. For example, the Everyone and World SIDs identify a group that includes all users. Well-known SIDs have values that remain constant across all operating systems.</p>
<p>SIDs are a fundamental building block of the Windows security model. They work with specific components of the authorization and access control technologies in the security infrastructure of the Windows Server operating systems. This helps protect access to network resources and provides a more secure computing environment.</p>
<p>The content in this topic applies to computers that are running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the <strong>Applies To</strong> list at the beginning of this topic.</p>
<h2 id="how-security-identifiers-work">How security identifiers work<a class="docon docon-link heading-anchor" href="#how-security-identifiers-work" aria-labelledby="how-security-identifiers-work"></a></h2>
<p>Users refer to accounts by using the account name, but the operating system internally refers to accounts and processes that run in the security context of the account by using their security identifiers (SIDs). For domain accounts, the SID of a security principal is created by concatenating the SID of the domain with a relative identifier (RID) for the account. SIDs are unique within their scope (domain or local), and they are never reused.</p>
<p>The operating system generates a SID that identifies a particular account or group at the time the account or group is created. The SID for a local account or group is generated by the Local Security Authority (LSA) on the computer, and it is stored with other account information in a secure area of the registry. The SID for a domain account or group is generated by the domain security authority, and it is stored as an attribute of the User or Group object in Active Directory Domain Services.</p>
<p>For every local account and group, the SID is unique for the computer where it was created. No two accounts or groups on the computer ever share the same SID. Likewise, for every domain account and group, the SID is unique within an enterprise. This means that the SID for an account or group that is created in one domain will never match the SID for an account or group created in any other domain in the enterprise.</p>
<p>SIDs always remain unique. Security authorities never issue the same SID twice, and they never reuse SIDs for deleted accounts. For example, if a user with a user account in a Windows domain leaves her job, an administrator deletes her Active Directory account, including the SID that identifies the account. If she later returns to a different job at the same company, an administrator creates a new account, and the Windows Server operating system generates a new SID. The new SID does not match the old one; so none of the user's access from her old account is transferred to the new account. Her two accounts represent two completely different security principals.</p>
<h2 id="security-identifier-architecture">Security identifier architecture<a class="docon docon-link heading-anchor" href="#security-identifier-architecture" aria-labelledby="security-identifier-architecture"></a></h2>
<p>A security identifier is a data structure in binary format that contains a variable number of values. The first values in the structure contain information about the SID structure. The remaining values are arranged in a hierarchy (similar to a telephone number), and they identify the SID-issuing authority (for example, “NT Authority”), the SID-issuing domain, and a particular security principal or group. The following image illustrates the structure of a SID.</p>
<p><img class="file1-pic" src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/images/security-identifider-architecture.jpg" alt="" data-linktype="relative-path"></p>
<p>The individual values of a SID are described in the following table.</p>
<div class="table-scroll-wrapper"><table class="table2"><caption class="visually-hidden">Table 1</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Comment</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Revision</td>
<td>Indicates the version of the SID structure that is used in a particular SID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Identifier authority</td>
<td>Identifies the highest level of authority that can issue SIDs for a particular type of security principal. For example, the identifier authority value in the SID for the Everyone group is 1 (World Authority). The identifier authority value in the SID for a specific Windows Server account or group is 5 (NT Authority).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Subauthorities</td>
<td>&gt;Holds the most important information in a SID, which is contained in a series of one or more subauthority values. All values up to, but not including, the last value in the series collectively identify a domain in an enterprise. This part of the series is called the domain identifier. The last value in the series, which is called the relative identifier (RID), identifies a particular account or group relative to a domain.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>The components of a SID are easier to visualize when SIDs are converted from a binary to a string format by using standard notation:</p>
      <pre tabindex="0" class="table2"><code data-author-content="S-R-X-Y1-Y2-Yn-1-Yn
">S-R-X-Y1-Y2-Yn-1-Yn
</code></pre>
<p>In this notation, the components of a SID are represented as shown in the following table.</p>
<div class="table-scroll-wrapper"><table class="table2"><caption class="visually-hidden">Table 2</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Comment</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>S</td>
<td>Indicates that the string is a SID</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R</td>
<td>Indicates the revision level</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>X</td>
<td>Indicates the identifier authority value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Y</td>
<td>Represents a series of subauthority values, where <em>n</em> is the number of values</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>The SID's most important information is contained in the series of subauthority values. The first part of the series (-Y1-Y2-Y<em>n</em>-1) is the domain identifier. This element of the SID becomes significant in an enterprise with several domains, because the domain identifier differentiates SIDs that are issued by one domain from SIDs that are issued by all other domains in the enterprise. No two domains in an enterprise share the same domain identifier.</p>
<p>The last item in the series of subauthority values (-Y<em>n</em>) is the relative identifier. It distinguishes one account or group from all other accounts and groups in the domain. No two accounts or groups in any domain share the same relative identifier.</p>
<p>For example, the SID for the built-in Administrators group is represented in standardized SID notation as the following string:</p>
      <pre tabindex="0" class="table2"><code data-author-content="S-1-5-32-544
      ">S-1-5-32-544
      </code></pre>
  <p>This SID has four components:</p>
  <ul>
<li><p>A revision level (1)</p>
</li>
<li><p>An identifier authority value (5, NT Authority)</p>
</li>
<li><p>A domain identifier (32, Builtin)</p>
</li>
<li><p>A relative identifier (544, Administrators)</p>
</li>
</ul>
      <p>SIDs for built-in accounts and groups always have the same domain identifier value: 32. This value identifies the domain <strong>Builtin</strong>, which exists on every computer that is running a version of the Windows Server operating system. It is never necessary to distinguish one computer's built-in accounts and groups from another computer's built-in accounts and groups because they are local in scope. They are local to a single computer, or in the case of domain controllers for a network domain, they are local to several computers that are acting as one.</p>
    <p>Built-in accounts and groups need to be distinguished from one another within the scope of the <strong>Builtin</strong> domain. Therefore, the SID for each account and group has a unique relative identifier. A relative identifier value of 544 is unique to the built-in Administrators group. No other account or group in the <strong>Builtin</strong> domain has a SID with a final value of 544.</p>
  <p>In another example, consider the SID for the global group, Domain Admins. Every domain in an enterprise has a Domain Admins group, and the SID for each group is different. The following example represents the SID for the Domain Admins group in the Contoso, Ltd. domain (Contoso\Domain Admins):</p>
        <pre tabindex="0" class="table2"><code data-author-content="S-1-5-21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330-512
      ">S-1-5-21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330-512
      </code></pre>
    <p>The SID for Contoso\Domain Admins has:</p>
    <ul>
  <li><p>A revision level (1)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>An identifier authority (5, NT Authority)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>A domain identifier (21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330, Contoso)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>A relative identifier (512, Domain Admins)</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>The SID for Contoso\Domain Admins is distinguished from the SIDs for other Domain Admins groups in the same enterprise by its domain identifier: 21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330. No other domain in the enterprise uses this value as its domain identifier. The SID for Contoso\Domain Admins is distinguished from the SIDs for other accounts and groups that are created in the Contoso domain by its relative identifier, 512. No other account or group in the domain has a SID with a final value of 512.</p>
