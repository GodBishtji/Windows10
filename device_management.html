    <h1>DEVICE MANAGEMENT IN WINDOWS 10</h1>
    <p>In windows 10, <b>Device Manager</b> is an application which helps to manage device.Device Manager is a Control Panel applet in Microsoft Windows operating systems. It allows users to view and control the hardware attached to the computer. When a piece of hardware is not working, the offending hardware is highlighted for the user to deal with. The list of hardware can be sorted by various criteria.</p>
    <p>For each device, users can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supply device drivers in accordance with the Windows Driver Model</li>
      <li>Enable or disable devices</li>
      <li>Tell Windows to ignore malfunctioning devices</li>
      <li>View other technical properties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Device Manager was introduced with Windows 95 and later added to Windows 2000. In NT-based versions, it is included as a Microsoft Management Console snap-in.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_icons">Types of icons</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Disabled_device">Disabled device</span></h3>
<p>A disabled device has either been manually disabled by a user or by some way of error. In Windows 95 through XP, this is denoted by a red X. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, this was replaced by a grey downward pointing arrow in the lower right-hand corner of the device's icon.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hardware_not_working_properly">Hardware not working properly</span></h3>
<p>There are many reasons why hardware may not work properly. If Windows recognizes a problem with a device, it is denoted by a black exclamation point (!) on a yellow triangle in the lower right-hand corner of the device's icon.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hardware_not_recognized">Hardware not recognized</span></h3>
<p>Hardware may not be recognized if it is not installed properly or not compatible with the system. This is denoted by a yellow question mark in place of the device's icon.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Device_manually_selected">Device manually selected</span></h3>
<p>A blue "i" on a white field in the lower right-hand corner of a Device's icon indicates that the <b>Use automatic settings</b> feature is not selected for the device and that the resource was manually selected. Note that this does not indicate a problem or disabled state.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Error_codes">Error codes</span></h2>
<p>Device Manager error codes are numerical codes, each accompanied by an error message, which help users determine what kind of issue Windows is having with a piece of hardware.
