For example,
          Windows Defender stores its virus definitions in <code>\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows
            Defender</code>. Programs do not have permission to store files in this folder, but have permission to create subfolders and store files in them. The organization of the files is at the discretion of the developer.

          (i.e. without a valid password-protected user account) to it is denied. This folder contains user data, not program data, meaning that users are expected to be sole decider of what is in this folder and how it is organized. It is unethical
          for a program to store its proprietary data here. (There are other folders dedicated to program data.)

          folder to keep its size in check. For security reasons and to avoid the DLL Hell issue, Windows enforces very stringent requirements on how the files in this folder are organized.
