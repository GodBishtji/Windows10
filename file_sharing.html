    <h1>FILE SHARING</h1>
    <p>File access services enable applications to discover,
access, and share files that are hosted on or made available by a file server,
using a network between them, in a secure and managed environment. File access
services also enable file servers to manage and replicate files in a
distributed environment </p>
<p>Most businesses and many personal computing environments
have a requirement for file hierarchies stored in a file system (object store)
on one computer to be accessed and manipulated by applications on other
computers. This scenario is typically referred to as file sharing or remote
file access. A key goal is to ensure application compatibility by providing
broadly the same semantics to clients as if the shared object store were local
to them. This compatibility would not be provided by sharing the files through
a protocol with more limited semantics, such as FTP or <span><a href="49801c02-2e60-4133-8c6a-d9e1b6d9c02a#gt_d72f1494-4917-4e9e-a9fd-b8f1b2758dcd" data-linktype="relative-path">HTTP</a></span>.
The file access protocols address the need for ensured compatibility.</p>
<p>The File Access Services Protocols Overview <span><a href="../ms-fasod/a8df7cf6-4f73-4441-8319-653618a50da0" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-FASOD]</a></span>
fully describes these protocols. The File Access Services protocols are listed
in [MS-FASOD] section <span><a href="../ms-fasod/0e86203b-5427-4889-8f7f-d047a7392c73" data-linktype="relative-path">2.2</a></span>.</p>
<p>Remote file systems enable an application that runs on a
local computer to access files stored on a remote computer. See [Rifkin1986]
for a discussion on providing transparent access to remote files. </p>
<p>Support for remote file systems in Windows is based on installable
drivers and therefore can be extended. The support of remote file systems
requires three components:</p>
<ul><li><p><span><span>
</span></span>Software installed on the client to use a transport protocol.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span>
</span></span>A transport protocol used for communication and a network
connection.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span>
</span></span>Software installed on the server to use a transport protocol.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The software component of a remote file system on a client
computer is referred to in Windows as a network redirector because it is
responsible for redirecting requests for file operations from local client
applications to a remote server where the requests are processed. The network
redirector receives responses from the remote server that are then returned to
the local application. The local application might be unaware that remote file
I/O rather than local file I/O has occurred. Hence the network redirector
software creates the appearance on the client system that remote files and
resources are the same as local files and resources and allows them to be used
and manipulated in the same way. In Windows, it is possible to have multiple
redirectors installed at any given time. The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) <span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151330" data-linktype="external">[MSDN-WinDriverKit]</a></span>
gives details for developing providers, which are essentially device drivers.</p>

store in Windows can be found in <span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=140636" data-linktype="external">[FSBO]</a></span>. </p>
<p>The Multiple UNC Provider component of Windows is a <span><a href="49801c02-2e60-4133-8c6a-d9e1b6d9c02a#gt_c9507dca-291d-4fd6-9cba-a9ee7da8c908" data-linktype="relative-path">Universal
Naming Convention (UNC)</a></span> resource locator responsible for determining
the correct provider for UNC connections. By using the Multiple UNC Provider to
find the provider for a UNC connection, Windows can simultaneously have
multiple network redirectors installed that support various formats of UNC
names.</p>
<p>With multiple redirectors that support UNC names, there is
the potential that more than one provider could service a UNC name. Therefore,
an arbitrator is needed. Windows inspects an application's UNC requests,
determines which of the currently installed providers, if any, can service the
UNC name, and routes the application request to that provider.</p>
<p>Provider selection is invoked as part of all UNC name-based
I/O requests. When Windows receives a UNC request, it accesses all of the
installed providers in order to determine which provider, or providers, can
accept the request. Further details on the process are available in
[WININTERNALS] section 13.</p>
<p>After the initial routing is determined, no further
interaction from provider selection is required and the application accesses
the file via the provider as it would any file-based service, whether local or
remote.</p>
<p>CIFS is a dialect of the <span><a href="49801c02-2e60-4133-8c6a-d9e1b6d9c02a#gt_09dbec39-5e75-4d9a-babf-1c9f1d499625" data-linktype="relative-path">SMB</a></span> network file
sharing protocol, designed to provide concurrent access to directories and
files hosted on servers. CIFS is applicable for all scenarios that involve transferring
files between client and server. It is also applicable for accessing
centralized print queues, and for interprocess communications using named
pipes.</p>
<p>The Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol specified in <span><a href="../ms-smb/f210069c-7086-4dc2-885e-861d837df688" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-SMB]</a></span>
lists extensions, enhancements, and clarifications to the CIFS protocol. In
contrast, the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Versions 2 and 3 specified in
<span><a href="../ms-smb2/5606ad47-5ee0-437a-817e-70c366052962" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-SMB2]</a></span>
is an entirely new file sharing protocol based on SMB concepts. Server Message
Block Protocol Versions 2 and 3 are referred to as the <i>SMB 2 Protocol</i>.</p>
<p>SMB and SMB 2 serve a special role in Windows protocols
because they offer a construct known as the <span><a href="49801c02-2e60-4133-8c6a-d9e1b6d9c02a#gt_34f1dfa8-b1df-4d77-aa6e-d777422f9dca" data-linktype="relative-path">named pipe</a></span>. The name
of the pipe serves as the <span><a href="49801c02-2e60-4133-8c6a-d9e1b6d9c02a#gt_b91c1e27-e8e0-499b-8c65-738006af72ee" data-linktype="relative-path">endpoint</a></span> for the

failover clustering, that are not part of the SMB 2 Protocol. For more
