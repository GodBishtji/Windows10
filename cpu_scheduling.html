    <h1>CPU SCHEDULING</h1>
    <p>Multilevel feedback queue algorithm is used on windows 10â€¦.In multilevel queue scheduling we assign a process to a queue and it remains in that queue until the process is allowed access to the CPU. That is, processes do not move between queues.
the ready queue is partitioned into multiple queues of different priorities. The system use to assign processes to queue based on their CPU burst characteristic. If a process consumes too much CPU time, it is placed into a lower priority queue.
Process that waits too long in a lower priority queue may be moved to a higher priority queue.</p>
<h3>Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling</h3>
<p>In a multilevel queue-scheduling algorithm, processes are permanently assigned to a queue on entry to the system. Processes do not move between queues. This setup has the advantage of low scheduling overhead, but the disadvantage of being inflexible.
<br>
Multilevel feedback queue scheduling, however, allows a process to move between queues. The idea is to separate processes with different CPU-burst characteristics. If a process uses too much CPU time, it will be moved to a lower-priority queue. Similarly, a process that waits too long in a lower-priority queue may be moved to a higher-priority queue. This form of aging prevents starvation.</p>

<p class="img-desc"><b>An example of a multilevel feedback queue can be seen in the below figure.</b></p>
<p>In general, a multilevel feedback queue scheduler is defined by the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="content">
<li>The number of queues.</li>
<li>The scheduling algorithm for each queue.</li>
<li>The method used to determine when to upgrade a process to a higher-priority queue.</li>
<li>The method used to determine when to demote a process to a lower-priority queue.</li>
<li>The method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that process needs service.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of a multilevel feedback queue scheduler makes it the most general CPU-scheduling algorithm. It can be configured to match a specific system under design. Unfortunately, it also requires some means of selecting values for all the parameters to define the best scheduler. Although a multilevel feedback queue is the <b>most general scheme</b>, it is also the <b>most complex</b>.</p>
